<h1>Todo-app-django</h1>
<p>This is my first simple django application built on django and deployed successfully on heroku.</p>

<p>You can find the deployed app on:</p>
<a href="https://todoapp-hema.herokuapp.com/">https://todoapp-hema.herokuapp.com/</a>
<p>It is where I didn't concentrate on the front-end and wanted only to know about the backend.</p>
<p>I was unable to host my previous projects on django.Later now I came through a clear cut video on youtube which helped me in deployment.</p>
